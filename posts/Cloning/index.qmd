There are different ways to clone a GitHub repository to your computer. I will talk about 3 of them:

- using a terminal/shell/Bash
- using RStudio
- using VSCode

## Cloning using the terminal (shell/Bash)

In your terminal, go to the directory where you want the repo to be cloned using the command 'cd'
Ex: cd desktop

In GitHub, go to the repository and click on the green "Code" button.
Copy the HTTPS adress of the repo:

In the terminal, type the command:
```{.bash}
git clone <the https adress>
```
If you want to change the name of the repository on your computer, add the new name at the end of the previous command:
```{.bash}
git clone <the https adress> <new name>
```
Et voila!!!

## Cloning using RStudio

:::{.callout-warning}
This will work only if you're cloning a repo from the GitHub account that is linked to RStudio
:::

Open RStudio. In File, select 'New Project'. This will open a "Create Project" window with 3 choices. Select "Version Control":

You will have the option of cloning a project from a Git repository. You will get this window:

![Clone Git Repository in RStudio](Clone_git_rstudio.png "Screenshot of the Clone Git Repository window")

Use the https adress as seen previously as the URL, give a project name and click the "Create Project" button.
Magic!

## Cloning using VSCode

Very easy!
From the start, VSCode offers to clone a Git repository! It also appears if you click on the source control icon to the left:

![Clone a Git repo in VSCode](Clone_VSCode.png "Access to clone Git repo in Visual Studio Code")

A small window will appear on top of the screen where you can paste the URL (use the HTTPS adress as seen previously).
:::{.callout-note}
You can click on "Clone from GitHub", a list of repository from the GitHub linked to VSCode will appear!
:::
A window will then appear so you can choose the destination for the repo.
Easy peasy!

You are now a Clone Master!
